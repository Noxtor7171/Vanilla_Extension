This modpack aims to optimize the game without losing vanilla mechanics and sprinkles of things that give additional atmosphere. Currently, only it works on Fabric Loader, but I plan to Quilt, Forge and Neoforge versions and all versions with VulkanMod, Nvidium, Distant Horizons and Voxy(some mods haven't in Forge and Neoforge, but I'll try make it in future). Also, maybe I'll port my modpack to older versions (1.16.5‚Äì1.19.4). But I don't want to promise anything because I'm the only one doing modpack(. I have other modpacks:

- [Optimized Maxima](https://modrinth.com/modpack/optimized-maxima) ‚Äî If you want to use only optimization, that I recommend installing this modpack. It updates faster to new versions.)))
 
- [[JWN] Just what is needed](https://modrinth.com/modpack/jwn) ‚Äî more compact modpack without resource packs and some features in Vanilla Extension. Suitable for just player who like more vanilla without decorations.

  
I want to make these things better in my modpack then on vanilla:
  
   **üìàPerformance**

I tried to pay special attention to performance, so I chose all the mods that seemed to me the best for this. In the future, I want to improve it even more. I am trying to remove mods that are not being used.

 **üóªMore atmosphere**

As you pass through the thickets of the forest, you can watch the leaves fall, and if you want to go into the mine, you will hear the screeching of the unholy through the reverberation, dripping of water near the underground aquifers...These are just some of the atmospheric things you can find in this modpack. Sound is 60% of gameplay.

*I think that it is useful as for single-player and as for multi-player))))*

**P.S: I don't enough to know English, so I may have mistakes. I hope that I make useful thing for you).**

##

I refused to translate the description because this was a waste of time (this is just a duplication). I can spend time on improvement of modpacks. But, if in future I'll have a team that maybe I'll return translation.

Also, I won't support 1.20.2 and 1.20.4. Because they have some problems with Quilt, Forge and NeoForge and devs less update mods for them. Please, use 1.20.1 or 1.20.6+. Furthermore, It's hard for me to update so many versions (understand me).
